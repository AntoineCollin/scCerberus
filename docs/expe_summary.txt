Expe make fake htap
deux expe : une avec seed = 71 & lr = 5, l'autre avec seed = 75, lr = 20

expe de base : pred de AJRCCM, HTAP, PBMC. random seed 42 43 44 45 46 47 (3 dernier pbmc only)
en croisant: 
ae_type = [contrastive, normal]
semi_sup = [False, True],
--
mode = 'fixed_number',
n_keep = [5,10,50,100],
--
mode = 'percentage':
pct_split = [0.1, 0.5,0.9],

adding 
split_strategy = ['avg_marker_ranking', 'sum_marker_score'] for PBMC & HTAP for fixed_number only


Expe integration Discovair & everything else
random seed 150
5 layers autoencoder with a (2000,128,64) as well as (128,64) to be comparable to scanvi 50
trying 80% and 99.9% (observe semi_sup setup, True & False) => 8 combination per dataset
disco-htap :  (4379-4386) scanvi (4791 4792)
disco-ajrccm : (4387-4394) scanvi (4789 4790)
disco-htap-ajrccm : (4371-4378), scanvi (4787 4788 (80% and 99.9%))



Expe fake prediction HTAP
random seed 76
adding 5 layers autoencoder with a (2000,128,64) as well as (128,64) to be comparable to scanvi 50 (4395 - 4786)


Expe prediction metrics :

test hidden size (2000,128,64,128,2000) vs 64 on ajrccm for contrastive (4793-4840) and normal (4841 - 4888) with every config but only random seed 42. Adding 43, 44 for a bit of significance

Expe biology conservation :
Compute DR for the PBMC8k_68k dataset on both dataset then individually on each dataset. Compute batch_entropy_mixing and knn_purity when comparing the latent space. Using one set of parameters, in normal mode (5107-5109) as well as batch removal mode (5110) and scanvi (5111-5113)
Same for PBMC8k_68k_augmented where we duplicated cells to balance the dataset. (5329 - 5335). Balanced downsampled (5611-5617)
Compute DR for the htap_final dataset on whole dataset then individually on each sample. Compute batch_entropy_mixing and knn_purity when comparing the latent space. Using one set of parameters, in normal mode (5114-5128) as well as batch removal mode (5129) and scanvi (5130-5144). Running same experiments with n_hvg = 5000 normal mode (), batch_removal (), scanvi ()

Boss experiment : integration between AJRCCM and Discovair
Same for Disco-ajrccm (5336 - 5342). Balanced downsampled (5618-5624)


Integrate/harmonize dataset partial overlaping between celltypes
If the previous experiment works well : Create a reduced PBMC8k_68k to only include common celltypes. Then train keeping only one celltype of PBMC8k ? Could do something similar on HTAP.
in HTAP, select donors C5 and C1 and celltype > 10 counts. Run expe in two setups (cf runfile factory). random seed=125. Setup 1 : 5343 - 5402, scanvi 5463 -5522. Setup 2 : 5403 - 5462, scanvi 5523 - 5582, CTRL 5584 - 5587
